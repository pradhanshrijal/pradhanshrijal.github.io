## Introduction

This article documents the steps taken to upgrade [Carla ROS Bridge] to be compabible with [Carla Simulator v0.9.15.2] and with Ubuntu 22.04. The changes are very simple and no functional improvements are applied.

## Patch and work

The patch work is very (very) simple. In the [Carla ROS Bridge] simply make this change in `pcl_recorder/CMakeLists.txt` in Line `69`.

```cmake
ament_target_dependencies(${PROJECT_NAME}_node rclcpp sensor_msgs
                            pcl_conversions tf2 tf2_ros tf2_eigen)
```

That's it really. The `tf2_eigen` must be additionally specified as a dependency to build `pcl_recorder` and we are good to go for the package to be built on Ubuntu 22.04 with `ROS Humble`.

Also don't for get to change the `CARLA_VERSION` in `carla_ros_bridge/src/carla_ros_bridge/CARLA_VERSION`.

```bash
0.9.15
```

## Update the Dockerfile
